CANCER RISK PREDICTOR
This project helps the user to identify the risk level of cancer to be affected
Based upon the Previously Collected Data which is Available in Kaggle . We can predict the Chance of Patient To be Affected by Cancer .Our Cancer Risk Prediction Model categorize the patient in three levels ( high , medium ,low), By using machine learning algorithm with the help of some features like Air pollution, Alcohol use, obesity, smoking, wheezing etc., .our frontend is going to designed with html &amp; CSS ,which helps to get values to assign for features . And process it with random forest classifier algorithm to predict the risk level of the patient
